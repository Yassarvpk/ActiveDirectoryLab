<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFSLaXvEvlY)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we are going to walk through how to create an Active Directory home lab Environment using Oracle Virtual Box. Configuring and running this lab will help develop your understanding of how active directory and Windows networking works, so I'd highly recommend running through it a couple of times, asking questions where stuff is unclear, and eventually trying to build it on your own without watching. Please let me know you if have any questions!
